# Design Notes

This directory contains short design notes and exploratory proposals
related to Spring AI Playground.

Design notes are **not commitments**.
They are intended to:
- Capture early ideas
- Discuss trade-offs
- Clarify boundaries before implementation

If you have a larger proposal that does not fit the current issue scope,
please submit a short design note PR here.
